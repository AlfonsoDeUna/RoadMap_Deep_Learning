# RoadMap Deep Learning

This is my own roadmap for learning the base and applications of deep learning. I'm focus on self-directed learning machine learning and the target is to get a guide or a road to achieve the knowledge. I want to share all my methods and resources whether you want to become a data scientist or to stisfy the desire knowledge. The level of the resources is irrelevant so I don't want a introduction but  I don't know either where is the finish0. For now the most important thing for this is learn in the best possible way.
